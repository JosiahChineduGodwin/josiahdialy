Hello World,
Its kinda fun programming especially if you have purpose. 
I love programming which is why I have learnt languages under curosity.
The languages are:
Python, 
Node.js,
RasperyPi,
PHP,
SQL,
ASP,
JAVASCRIPT,
BOOTSTRAP,
SASS,
CSS and
HTML.
In all my passion is python, but use all other language for support.
No project at the moment, hoping to have one soon.
Doing different things with python is fun.
Love Programming!!!!!!
